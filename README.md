# About
A page dedicated to all those interested in learning hard concepts in the easiest way possible, free of charge. This page was created for personal benifit and for all those interested. This is a journal of all the things that I have studied and am currently studying. The lightbulb aspects the I get when studying will also be logged is this site.

# Goal
The goal in making this page is to explain technical concepts in the easiest way possible, which is of course dificult, but this is the goal. It is created for game engineers and developers and engineering in general.

# Recomendations for all Contributions
All contributions are welcome. If you feel you can explain a concept in a very simple way, realized a why you just had a lightbulb moment, or you have knowledge and hours of practice, please consider contributing, as it will be a benifit to many. Please consider this one goal: less is always more. Please consider breaking up the lessons so they do not become too complicated or bunched up together.
